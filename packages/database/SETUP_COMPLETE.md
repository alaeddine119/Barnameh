  - Operational entities (organizations, locations, resources, employees)
  - Time-series data (events, metrics, demand history)
  - ML predictions (demand forecasts, anomaly detection)
  - Scheduling & planning (shifts, production plans)
  - Alerts & notifications

### 🎯 **Sample Data Loaded**
```
Organizations:       2 companies (Manufacturing & Logistics)
Locations:           3 facilities  
Resources:           5 machines/vehicles
Employees:           7 workers with skills
Demand History:      182 records (90 days)
Operational Events:  981 events (30 days)
Resource Metrics:    Hourly data (7 days)
Forecasts:           60 predictions (30 days ahead)
Anomaly Predictions: 2 active alerts
```

### 🐍 **Python Utilities**
- `DatabaseManager`: Connection pooling & query execution
- `OperationalDataQueries`: Pre-built queries for common operations

## 📊 Sample Queries to Get Started

### Get Demand Trend
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(time) as date,
    product_name,
    SUM(quantity) as total_demand
FROM demand_history
WHERE organization_id = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(time), product_name
ORDER BY date;
```

### Resource Utilization
```sql
SELECT 
    r.name,
    AVG(rm.utilization_rate) as avg_utilization,
    MAX(rm.utilization_rate) as peak_utilization
FROM resource_metrics rm
JOIN resources r ON rm.resource_id = r.id
WHERE rm.time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY r.name
ORDER BY avg_utilization DESC;
```

### Active Alerts
```sql
SELECT 
    severity,
    title,
    description,
    created_at
FROM alerts
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY 
    CASE severity
        WHEN 'critical' THEN 1
        WHEN 'high' THEN 2
        WHEN 'medium' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database won't start?
```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

### Connection refused?
```bash
docker compose ps  # Check if containers are running
docker compose logs postgres  # Check logs
```

### Need to reset everything?
```bash
cd packages/database
